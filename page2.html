        <h1>What is Techno-Stress?</h1>
        <p>Technostress is the stress or psychosomatic illness caused by working with computer technologies. It arises from the struggle to accept new computer technologies and the feeling of being overwhelmed by constant connectivity.  It includes feelings of anxiety, depression, confusion, and burnout. This is particularly prevalent in the workplace, where computers are used heavily and digitalized platforms are the main tools employees use to carry out their work.

With increased technology usage, research aims to understand the effects this has on an individual’s health. But first, it is important to understand the concept of technostress in a bit more depth.</p>
